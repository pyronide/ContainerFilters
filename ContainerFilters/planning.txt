this file contains the plan for container filters' implimentation.

	DOES NOTHING MORE THAN ADD CONTRAINTS TO THE CONTAINER BLOCK VIA A FILTER A LA SORTERS !! NO ACTIVE PULLING/PUSHING (probs coming
		in a block soon tm)

---create list of all inventory items to be used by the filter UI---

	I can probably do this the same way that keen/Meridius is doing it, need to get familiar with that code. oof.
	I'll populate a list of names, and that's what gets displayed in the filter list. pretty self-explanitory, but I
	needed this here to help remember. I did this while running on fumes...

---create presets to use in filter UI - Ores, Ingots, Components, character tools and weapons, ammo, etc...---
	
	same as above. I think keen already has some sort of nomenclature for this... ?

add inventory filter UI elements to block terminal (k menu) - this is done in UpdateBeforeSimulation, along with associated actions
 
 - add blacklist/whitelist functionality (whitelist all by default)
		- this could be difficult to impiment. gonna stick with whitelist only for now...
 - add preset filter options
 - add refresh button that updates inventory constriaints...
